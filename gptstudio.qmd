## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}

# remotes::install_github("MichelNivard/gptstudio")

# load ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

# pipe mtcars data set into dplyr::mutate function, which will create a new column called mpg, which is the square of the mpg column
mtcars |>
  dplyr::mutate(mpg = mpg ^ 2)

# create a scatter plot of mpg vs disp, using the mtcars data set
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) + 
  geom_point()

```
